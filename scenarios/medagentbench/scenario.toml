# Multi-Worker Parallel Execution Configuration
# Number of agent worker processes to spawn for true parallelism.
# Each worker runs as a separate process on a different port (9019, 9020, etc.)
# Tasks are distributed across workers, enabling independent parallel execution.
# - Set to 1 for sequential execution (default, single worker)
# - Set to 5-10 for moderate parallelism
# - Set to 20 for high parallelism 
# Higher values require more system resources (CPU, memory, network connections).
