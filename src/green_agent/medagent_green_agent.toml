Your task is to instantiate MedAgentBench to test the agent located at:
<white_agent_url>
http://localhost:9002/
</white_agent_url>

You should use the following configuration:
<medagent_config>
{
  "mcp_server_url": "http://0.0.0.0:8002",
  "max_rounds": 9,
  "task_data": {
    "id": "task1_1",
    "instruction": "What's the MRN of the patient with name Peter Stafford and DOB of 1932-12-29?",
    "context": "If the patient does not exist, the answer should be \"Patient not found\"",
    "sol": ["S6534835"]
  }
}
</medagent_config>

Note: The MCP server at http://0.0.0.0:8002 provides tools for interacting with the FHIR server.
The white agent will use these tools to query patient information and complete medical tasks.
